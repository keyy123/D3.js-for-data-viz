## Q: What makes a good visualization?
E: 
### 1. Understand the context

	- Before you write anything related to data visualization answer the following questions: 
	- Who is the audience?
	- What do they need to know?
	- What do they need to do with the data?

### 2. Choose an appropriate visualization
	- This is only possible after you complete step 1
	- Some visualizations are more suited to communicating specific types of data than others like how some algo are better suited to certain problems than others. 

### 3. Remove clutter or necessary information
	- There is a very real chance data has clutter (info not vital to be shown)
	- Example: In map vizs, people remove towns so it does not overwhelm the reader since cities and towns are closeby. Leaving only the main cities give an overall understanding. 
	- This clutter should not be shown 

### 4. Draw attention using shapes, size, and color
	- If there is something you want a user/anyone to focus on, Don't be scared to make it larger, or flashier. 
	- It helps make the data visualization more interesting

### 5. Tell a story with your data
	- You learn this skill from experience and studying other data visualizations
	- The best vizs tell a story with their data. 

## What is D3?

D3 === Data-Driven Documents

D3 helps make web visualizations by giving us functions to show data on the document (document = the web page on the user's browser).

There are 2 main parts: The data and document

Remember: *data* drives the visualization NEVER the other way around. The visualization should represent the data no matter what the data looks like andhow it's shaped. 

If there is some data missing then the visuals need to be changed 


Here is a common process for creating data vizs:
1. Prepare the data
2. Create the chart container with proper dimensions
3. Create scale functions
4. Draw the data on the chart
5. Add interactivity (optional)
